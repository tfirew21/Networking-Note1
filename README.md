# Networking and Lab works. networking is like a higyway system that connects cites and states togather, from one point to another.
WHAT IS COMPUTER NETWORKING? A computer networking is a connection of computhing device that are logically  connected togather to communicate and share resource.
NODE, refere to any device on the network. eg computer and router  and printer. modem and printer, which  are connect through  links. NODE has a HOST, which is a unique function 
HOW DOES NODE WORK? A NODE is like a computer, router, swiches.
COMPUTER A- typical node on a network.on the network.it can be either a client and server.
NETWORK INTERFACE CARDS, connect a computer to a network cable
SWICH to connect multiple device on a network.
ROUTER connect multiple swiches on a network.
OSI MODEL= open interconnection model define a standard for how computer can share information over a network.
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network. It was the first standard model for network communications, adopted by all major computer and telecommunication companies in the early 1980s
[7]APPLICATION LAYER= The application layer is used by end-user software such as web browsers and email clients. It provides protocols that allow software to send and receive information and present meaningful data to users. A few examples of application layer protocols are the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Post Office Protocol (POP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and Domain Name System (DNS).
[6] PRESENTATION LAYER=The presentation layer prepares data for the application layer. It defines how two devices should encode, encrypt, and compress data so it is received correctly on the other end. The presentation layer takes any data transmitted by the application layer and prepares it for transmission over the session layer
[5] SESTION LAYER= The session layer creates communication channels, called sessions, between devices. It is responsible for opening sessions, ensuring they remain open and functional while data is being transferred, and closing them when communication ends. The session layer can also set checkpoints during a data transfer—if the session is interrupted, devices can resume data transfer from the last checkpoint.
[4] TRANSPORT LAYER= The transport layer takes data transferred in the session layer and breaks it into “segments” on the transmitting end. It is responsible for reassembling the segments on the receiving end, turning it back into data that can be used by the session layer.
[3]NETWORK LAYER=The network layer has two main functions. One is breaking up segments into network packets, and reassembling the packets on the receiving end
[2]DATA LINK LAYER= The data link layer establishes and terminates a connection between two physically-connected nodes on a network. It breaks up packets into frames and sends them from source to destination. This layer is composed of two parts—Logical Link Control (LLC), which identifies network protocols, performs error checking and synchronizes frames, and Media Access Control (MAC) which uses MAC addresses to connect devices and define permissions to transmit and receive data.
[1] PHYSICAL LAYER=The physical layer is responsible for the physical cable or wireless connection between network nodes.
